# Vimarsha — Build Roadmap (Step-by-Step Pointers)

> **Status:** Living · **Last updated:** 2026-06-11
> Part of the [knowledge base](../README.md). Current state → App Store, as discrete
> one-liner pointers. Each **V-item is a self-contained task** sized for its own agent
> window. Companion to the milestone view in [build-plan](build-plan.md) and
> [roadmap](../01-product/roadmap.md).

## How to run a pointer in a fresh agent window

> Open a new agent window in this repo and say: *"Read
> `plan/08-engineering/build-roadmap.md` + the docs it links for **VXX**, then implement
> **VXX**."* Each item lists its context docs (↳) and dependencies (needs …). Do items
> roughly in order; items in the same phase with no shared dependency can run in parallel
> windows (one [track](_progress-A.md) per window — respect file scopes).

**House rules for every V-item** (from [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) + [`apple/CLAUDE.md`](../../apple/CLAUDE.md)):
TDD where there's logic (Swift Testing); feature branch → small commits with the repo
trailer → suites green (`xcodebuild … test` both destinations; commands in
[apple/CLAUDE.md §Project setup](../../apple/CLAUDE.md)) → code-quality review → `--no-ff`
merge to `main` → **append an entry to your track's `_progress-<X>.md` with evidence**.
Motion-touching items additionally pass the **motion review** (record the interaction,
check it against the named pattern). Mark the item ✅/🚧 here when you update progress.

**Legend:** `↳` context docs · `(needs Vxx)` dependency · `[SPIKE]` de-risk/prove-it ·
`[verify]` checkpoint, run on a real device/simulator · ✅ done · 🚧 in progress.

## Phase P0 — Foundations (done)

- **V01** ✅ · Xcode project scaffold: multiplatform (iOS 26 + macOS 26), folder-synchronized
  pbxproj, `Vimarsha` + `VimarshaTests` targets, shared scheme, MainActor-default isolation.
  — _Done 2026-06-11, commit `d3c4248`._ ↳ [apple/CLAUDE.md §Project setup](../../apple/CLAUDE.md)
- **V02** ✅ · Palette tokens (`Design/Palette.swift`): raw palette + ink ramp + semantic
  dark-first colors + book-rendering tokens; hexes in ONE place. — _Done 2026-06-11._
  ↳ [apple/CLAUDE.md §Color palette](../../apple/CLAUDE.md)
- **V03** ✅ · Depth-stack parallax scroll with static books: `StackTransform` pure math
  (7 tests), `BookSeed` shelf, generated hardback covers, `visualEffect` transforms, glass
  top-scrim + Reduce Motion/Transparency fallbacks. — _Done 2026-06-11, verified both
  platforms + dark/light screenshots; review pass fixed the recede-tuck direction._
  ↳ [motion-grammar](../03-design/motion-grammar.md) · [_progress-A](_progress-A.md)

## Phase P1 — The living library

> Goal: the library stops being a render and becomes the signature *interaction* — every
> motion-grammar pattern present and tuned against the reference.

- **V04** ✅ · Settle contrast shift: header ghost→full contrast as a function of
  distance-to-rest (scroll-driven, no timers); ghost title also dims as the tower scrolls
  under the glass plane. — _Done 2026-06-11, commit `532ffd2`; `HeaderContrast` pure math
  (7 tests) + ImageRenderer snapshot, both suites green. Glass-header-plane refraction
  (covers bloom through ghost) deferred to V09/polish; live scroll feel → V09 motion review._
  ↳ [motion-grammar](../03-design/motion-grammar.md) ·
  [apple/CLAUDE.md §Motion grammar #7](../../apple/CLAUDE.md)
- **V05** ✅ · **[SPIKE]** Lensing drag puck: a small `glassEffect` drop tracking the active
  drag, refracting the cover beneath; prove the look + cost on device. (needs V03)
  — _Done 2026-06-11, commit `c904379`; `LensingPuck` pure geometry (7 tests) +
  `LensingPuckView` (interactive glass circle + opaque fallback) wired via a zero-distance
  `simultaneousGesture` (rides alongside scroll, Reduce Motion suppresses). Both suites green
  + present/absent overlay snapshot. The live glass-refraction **feel + cost** (120Hz flick
  budget, Instruments) needs an injectable drag the agent loop lacks → folded into V09._
  ↳ [apple/CLAUDE.md §Glass moments #2](../../apple/CLAUDE.md)
- **V06** ✅ · Book-focus state: scroll-settle detection (which book owns the front slot),
  grow-to-front emphasis curve + deepening contact shadow, focused-book metadata reveal.
  (needs V03) — _Done 2026-06-11, commit `40aea2b`; `BookFocus` pure math (9 tests) — the
  card nearest the front slot owns it, eased `promotion` drives a grow-to-front scale bump +
  deepening contact shadow on the focused card + `FocusMetadataView` reveal (matte/paper,
  snapshot-tested). Per-card midY via `CardMidYKey`; Reduce Motion pins `.none`. Both suites
  green; live launch focus verified. Live grow-to-front **feel** → V09 motion review._
  ↳ [screen-flows §Book focus](../03-design/screen-flows.md) ·
  [apple/CLAUDE.md §Motion grammar #2](../../apple/CLAUDE.md)
- **V07** ✅ · Glass control cluster: Play/Figures/Memo/Discuss controls morph out of the
  focused cover (`GlassEffectContainer` + `glassEffectID`), re-absorb on scroll; stub
  actions. (needs V06) — _Done 2026-06-11, commit `780b36b`; `ControlCluster` pure math
  (11 tests) — `promotion → emerge` (smoothstep above a settle threshold) + symmetric fan-out
  offsets. `ControlClusterView` melds the four glass controls into one blob when absorbed and
  splits them as `emerge` rises (`GlassEffectContainer` + `glassEffectID`); play tinted aqua,
  rest sky; Reduce Transparency matte fallback; inert + accessibilityHidden until emerged.
  Wired into `LibraryStackView`'s bottom `focusAffordances` (hosts the V06 metadata reveal).
  Both suites green + emerged/absorbed snapshot + live real-glass capture. Live scroll-settle
  morph **feel + glass cost** → V09 motion review._
  ↳ [apple/CLAUDE.md §Glass moments #5](../../apple/CLAUDE.md) ·
  [screen-flows](../03-design/screen-flows.md)
- **V08** ✅ · Slot-emit staircase entrance: covers rise from the bottom shelf anchor on first
  appearance, scroll-driven (scrubbable), no overshoot. (needs V03) — _Done 2026-06-11, commit
  `4d06e01`; `SlotEmit` pure math (9 tests) — the emit band runs from the viewport bottom edge
  (anchor) up to the front slot (arrived), so `progress = clamp((vh−midY)/((1−frontSlot)·vh),0,1)`
  and a cover travels its full rise as it scrolls into the slot. Ease-out soft landing (no
  overshoot past identity); composed with `StackTransform` in `BookTower` — emit owns below the
  slot, recede owns above, they meet at the slot with no jump. Stagger is intrinsic (staggered
  midYs). Both suites green + anchored/arrived snapshot + live launch. Live scrubbing **feel** (the
  springy-no-overshoot landing at flick velocity) → V09 motion review._
  ↳ [motion-grammar #4](../03-design/motion-grammar.md)
- **V09** ✅ · **[verify]** Motion review vs the reference: record scroll/flick/focus on the
  iPhone simulator + a device if available; check each named pattern against
  [the reference analysis](../../apple/docs/reference/ref-books-video-analysis.md); tune
  `StackTransform` constants; file deviations as findings. (needs V04–V08)
  — _Machine half done 2026-06-11 (suites green, static audit of all 7 patterns, captures).
  **Human review done 2026-06-11 (user): verdict = current stack isn't good enough** —
  cards must be ONE size, stacking tighter/neater, overall UI lifted
  ([ADR-011](../00-overview/decision-log.md#adr-011--uniform-book-card-geometry-in-the-library-stack)).
  Verdict + the audit findings (incl. the missing motion grammar #5) filed as
  **Phase P1.5 (V22–V26)** below. Full findings: [V09-motion-review](V09-motion-review.md)._

## Phase P1.5 — Library visual quality (user review round 1)

> Inserted 2026-06-11 from the V09 verdict — numbered after P3's V21. **Do these before
> P2:** the stack is the product's face; building real-book plumbing onto a look the owner
> calls "not good" compounds the rework. Findings source: [V09-motion-review](V09-motion-review.md).

- **V22** ✅ · Uniform book cards ([ADR-011](../00-overview/decision-log.md#adr-011--uniform-book-card-geometry-in-the-library-stack)):
  ONE card geometry for every book — same width (~0.70 of viewport, cap 460) and same
  aspect (~0.50); delete the per-index `widthFactor` rhythm and stop using `BookSeed.aspect`
  for card sizing (keep the field for future cover-art fitting). Tighten stack spacing so
  the overlap is even and the pile reads neat and editorial, not scattered. Update affected
  tests/snapshots. — _Done 2026-06-11, commit `53d7dec`; `CardGeometry` pure math (5 tests):
  `widthFraction 0.70`/`widthCap 460`/`aspect 0.50` + capped `width(forViewportWidth:)`. Both
  view branches + `HardbackCoverView` use it; `widthFactor`/`BookSeed.aspect` dropped from
  layout; overlap tightened `-0.04`→`-0.052`. Both suites green + rest captures (dark+light)
  show an even uniform-width staircase. V09 double-title + cluster tint left for V24._
  ↳ [V09-motion-review](V09-motion-review.md) ·
  [apple/CLAUDE.md §Physical book rendering](../../apple/CLAUDE.md)
- **V23** ✅ · Stack depth polish: receded covers truly **dissolve** under the glass scrim
  (opacity → 0 over the last ~15% of travel, below the rear floor); subtle desaturation on
  recede (full chroma at front → ~0.85 at the floor); re-tune `StackTransform` constants
  (tuck/falloffs/shadows) for the uniform-card stack so depth reads strong with same-size
  cards. (needs V22) — _Done 2026-06-11, commit `2559eb1`, merged `76ca193`; `StackTransform`
  gains a `saturation` field (1.0→0.85 floor, `saturationFalloff 0.25`) + a scrim-dissolve term
  (opacity below the 0.35 floor → 0 over the last `dissolveBand 0.15`vh of travel, ending at the
  top edge); `rearScaleFloor 0.62→0.60` for stronger depth. Wired via `.saturation()` in the
  `visualEffect` chain. Both suites green + dark/light rest captures show OPTIC dissolving under
  the scrim. Live mid-scroll melt/desat feel → V26 re-review._
  ↳ [V09-motion-review](V09-motion-review.md) audit rows #1/#3
- **V24** ✅ · Focus & cluster fixes from V09: fade the cover's debossed title while the
  metadata reveal shows (kill the double title); cluster glass tint butter → **sky** per the
  glass rules; anchor the cluster *inside* the focused cover's bottom edge (no overlap onto
  the next book); strengthen grow-to-front if it reads weak. (needs V22) — _Done 2026-06-11,
  merged `899e234`; `HardbackCoverView.titleOpacity` fades the focused cover's debossed title
  by `1 - promotion`; new `FocusAffordancePlacement` (pure math, 7 tests) + `CardTopYKey` anchor
  the metadata/cluster inside the focused cover's visible bottom (above the next book);
  `ControlClusterView` tint raised (sky 0.16→0.26 / aqua 0.22→0.32 — the "butter" was the gold
  cover refracting through weak glass, tint choice was already sky/aqua); `BookFocus.scaleBoost`
  0.04→0.07. Both suites green + dark/light/forced-emerge captures show the faded title + cool
  sky/aqua cluster on the focused cover. **Out-of-scope finding for V25/V26:** front-slot 0.72
  can focus the behind-stack book, not the dominant front cover._
  ↳ [V09-motion-review](V09-motion-review.md) · [apple/CLAUDE.md §Liquid Glass rules](../../apple/CLAUDE.md)
- **V25** ✅ · Coupled scroll+zoom hero settle — the missing motion grammar **#5**: a
  scroll-progress-driven rigid-group scale of the whole tower coupled to the header
  translate-off, anchored on a fixed point; scrubbable, ease-in-out, no timers; Reduce
  Motion exempt. (needs V23) — _Done 2026-06-11, commits `c7b4d86`+`7df43b3`, merged `1c31b84`;
  `HeroSettle` pure math (10 tests): `distanceToRest` → smoothstep ease-in-out from `baseScale`
  1.0 (zoomed-out hero, header visible) to `peakScale` 1.06 over `settleBand` 0.55 vh, then
  holding; one `scaleEffect` on `BookTower` as a rigid group (per-card parallax rides inside),
  anchored on the front slot (0.72) so the front cover holds; Reduce Motion pins to rest. Both
  suites green + rest capture (no-op at distance 0). Live zoom **feel** + the in-bounds anchor
  approximation → V26 re-review._

  [reference analysis](../../apple/docs/reference/ref-books-video-analysis.md)
- **V27** ✅ · Glass top-scrim redesign — contextual visibility (user finding 2026-06-11):
  at rest the scrim capsule read as a **giant empty pill dangling at the top** (both modes,
  worse on the light/butter canvas). — _Done 2026-06-11, commit `fbff4f2`, merged `e412a15`;
  `TopScrim` pure math (9 tests): scrim opacity is a scroll-driven function of the nearest
  cover's top-edge proximity to the viewport top (triangular window, strongest across the
  stack) — invisible at rest, fades in only while a cover dissolves under the top, out after.
  Reshaped from a floating padded capsule to a full-width bottom-rounded band hugging the top
  safe area (`ignoresSafeArea(.top)`); tint re-tuned per mode (sky 0.22 dark / 0.13 light);
  Reduce Transparency matte follows the same visibility rule. Both suites green + rest
  captures (dark+light) confirm the empty pill is gone in both modes. **Appears-during-recede
  is device-gated → verified in the V26 human re-review.**_
  ↳ [apple/CLAUDE.md §Glass moments #1](../../apple/CLAUDE.md) ·
  [V09-motion-review](V09-motion-review.md)
- **V26** ✅ · **[verify]** Library quality re-review: rebuild; capture rest / mid-scroll /
  focused states (dark + light) + a scroll recording if possible; check uniform sizing,
  neat stacking, scrim dissolve, hero zoom, and the cluster fixes against
  [ADR-011](../00-overview/decision-log.md#adr-011--uniform-book-card-geometry-in-the-library-stack)
  and the V09 findings; also eyeball the V05 puck's glass strength and the slot-emit landing
  character; **verify the V27 scrim behavior (invisible at rest, appears only during
  recede)**; then stop for human sign-off. (needs V24, V25, V27)
  — _**Machine half done 2026-06-11; needs human review.** Both suites green; fresh rest
  captures (dark+light) in [`artifacts/V26/`](../../.agent-loop/artifacts/V26/) confirm the
  STATIC quality: uniform cards (ADR-011), neat stacking, scrim dissolve — both modes.
  **Scroll-/gesture-revealed states are device-gated** (no sim gesture injection): hero zoom
  (V25 is a rest no-op), the focused state (V24 cluster/title-fade — promotion ~0 at launch
  rest), slot-emit/recede feel, the V05 puck, and the open `frontSlot 0.72` vs dominant-cover
  calibration. Full findings + human run-book → [_progress-A](_progress-A.md) V26 entry; `V26`
  written to `.agent-loop/NEEDS_HUMAN`. **Closed 2026-06-11 by user directive** ("aage
  badhao" — proceed to P2) after reviewing the final rest captures (dark+light). The
  device-gated motion-FEEL checks (hero zoom strength, focus/cluster live morph, flick
  landing, puck glass) were NOT individually scrubbed — carried as **review debt** into the
  next [verify] gates (V15/V21), which run on live scrolling anyway._

## Phase P2 — Real books

> Goal: the stack shows *your* EPUBs; chapters fetch from the (local) backend through the
> real seam. Mirrors the proven Flutter data-layer design — port the design, not the code.

- **V10** ✅ · EPUB import: document picker (iOS + macOS), security-scoped bookmark, copy into
  the app container; entitlements. — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `bd67c3b`; `EpubImporter`
  (3 tests, real file IO): picked EPUB → `Library/Books/<id>/book.epub`, container-relative
  result, scoped access released after copy, half-state rollback. Glass "+" → `fileImporter`
  (UTType.epub) in `LibraryStackView`; `Config/Vimarsha.entitlements` (macOS app-sandbox +
  user-selected read-only + network client) wired `sdk=macosx*`. Both suites green with the
  sandbox ON; live pick is device-gated → V15._
  ↳ [app-architecture](../04-architecture/app-architecture.md) ·
  Flutter reference: `app/lib/features/library/`
- **V11** ✅ · **[SPIKE]** Client-side cover extraction from EPUB (container.xml → OPF →
  cover-image manifest item; fall back to first image / generated cloth cover). Proves
  [ADR-006](../00-overview/decision-log.md#adr-006--cover-art-is-client-side). (needs V10)
  — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `69aa1c5`; `ZipArchive` (minimal stored+deflate reader, 5
  tests) + `EpubCover` ladder (EPUB3 properties → EPUB2 meta → cover-ish id → first image,
  7 tests) + importer writes `cover.<ext>` (+2). **Proven on a real Penguin EPUB** → true
  cover art (artifact in `.agent-loop/artifacts/V11/`). Spike findings (blank first-image
  on cover-less pirate EPUBs; iCloud unpacked-directory EPUBs) logged in
  [_progress-A](_progress-A.md). Rendering real covers in the stack lands with V12._
- **V12** ✅ · SwiftData models + persistence: Books/Chapters with status + progress; the
  static `BookSeed` shelf becomes the empty-state/demo path. (needs V10)
  — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `3710c6d`; `Book`/`Chapter` @Models (data-model.md v1 slice,
  raw-string status, cascade) + `LibraryStore` (@Observable: load/addBook/deleteBook,
  `EpubInfo` dc:title/creator, off-main `CoverArt` downsample) + `BookSeed`→`ShelfBook`

  art-vs-cloth snapshot; both suites green. Live picker round-trip → V15._
  ↳ [data-model](../04-architecture/data-model.md)

  models) + `Multipart` builder + `URLSessionBackendClient` (localhost default);
  `LibraryStore.addBook` = copy → cover → `/toc` → book + chapter rows, all-or-nothing with

- **V14** ✅ · Lazy chapter download: `POST /import?chapter_index=N` → bundle JSON + MP3 cached
  in the container; per-chapter status (none/pending/ready/error) + progress UI on the
  chapter list. (needs V13) — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `fd320ed`; `ChapterBundle` DTOs
  (schema-exact) + seam trio (`/import`+`/audio`+`/image`) + `ChapterDownloader`
  (all-or-nothing cache, best-effort figure images) + `LibraryStore.downloadChapter`
  (cancellable store-owned job, self-heal on load) + `ChapterListView` (glass-backed
  chapter plane off the focused book's Play control, full lifecycle affordances).

  chapters list from `/toc`, one chapter narrates end-to-end against the local backend
  (`uv run uvicorn vimarsha.server:app --port 8000`). (needs V11, V14)
  — _Machine half done 2026-06-11: live `/toc` → `/import` (real Chatterbox, 3m18s) →
  `/audio` (valid 24.6s MP3 matching paraTimings) round-trip with `sample.epub`; the live
  bundle decodes through the client's actual `ChapterBundleDTO`; both suites green on
  `main`. Artifacts: [`artifacts/V15/`](../../.agent-loop/artifacts/V15/). **Needs human
  review:** the on-device gesture flow — pick a real EPUB via "+", cover in the stack,
  Play → chapter plane, tap-to-narrate (minutes on MPS) → ready, relaunch persistence,
  error/retry path. Full run-book in [_progress-A](_progress-A.md) V15 entry. Note: live
  `GET /image` is unverified (fixture has no images — use a real illustrated book). **Closed 2026-06-11 under the deferred-review
  directive** — pipeline proven live (toc/import/audio + DTO decode); the on-device UX run
  moved to [final-review-checklist](final-review-checklist.md)._

## Phase P3 — Narrated reading

> Goal: the product's core loop — listen to a chapter with live highlight and figures on
> cue — entirely on the one morphing surface.

- **V16** ✅ · Audio engine: app-lifetime shared playback owner (AVFoundation), play/pause/
  seek/speed/resume, throttled progress persistence; the audio seam + test double. (needs V14)
  — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `424264e`; `AudioEngine` seam (ms-int API) +
  `AVFoundationAudioEngine` (AVAudioPlayer, real-WAV-tested) + `PlayerController`

  (matched geometry; the cover art is the shared element); back-morph on close. (needs V07)
  — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `bc125a2`; `ReadingSurfaceView` shell (cover plate + serif
  masthead + glass close + ready mark) opened from a now-actionable READY chapter row; the
  tower card hands matched-geometry source to the plate and hides while open; Reduce Motion
  cross-dissolves. Both suites green + forced-state captures (dark/light) + rest regression.

  paragraph highlight + auto-scroll driven by `paraTimings`. (needs V16, V17)
  — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `31ad540`; `TimingIndex` (the one lookups owner, 8 tests) +

- **V21** ✅ · **[verify]** Eyes-free run: a full real chapter listened end-to-end on device —
  highlight tracks, figures pop on cue, seek/speed/resume all work, offline replay from
  cache works. (needs V19, V20) — _Machine half done 2026-06-11, **human review deferred
  to final** ([checklist](final-review-checklist.md) §V21). Live harness over the
  PRODUCTION client files (BackendClient/ChapterDownloader/TimingIndex/
  AVFoundationAudioEngine): real `/toc`→`/import`→cache, the whole chapter **played
  through to `onFinish` at 2×** with every timed block the live highlight at some tick
  (9/9) and every spanned figure popping in-span (3/3, 0 leaks), seek/rate/resume +
  offline replay from cache — **ALL PASS**
  ([harness-run.log](../../.agent-loop/artifacts/V21/harness-run.log)). **Found + fixed
  a real bug:** `URLSession.shared`'s 60s idle timeout killed any real `/import`
  (narration is minutes of server silence) → narration-length session, merged `187a287`.
  Both suites green on `main`._

## Phase P-FIX — UI audit fixes (round 1)

> Inserted 2026-06-11 by the **independent UI audit** (fresh `main` build, iPhone 17 Pro
> sim, rest-state captures dark/light/XXXL/increased-contrast). Findings + artifacts:

- **V37** ✅ · **[blocker]** Metadata reveal collides with the neighbor cover: at launch rest
  the focused book's white serif title + letterspaced subtitle straddle the cover seam and

  Fix direction: anchor the reveal strictly inside the focused cover's own bounds (or a
  dedicated plate below it) with a hard clip — verify at medium AND XXXL, both modes.
  — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `aeb943b`; two root causes: the anchor used LAYOUT tops while
  covers draw transformed (`CardVisualTop` pure math, 5 tests, published per card), and the
  stack had no height bound (`FocusAffordancePlacement.maxHeight` +5 tests +
  `ViewThatFits` metadata-yields + `.clipped()` backstop). Both suites green; rest captures
  medium+XXXL × dark+light in `.agent-loop/artifacts/V37/` show the collision gone._

- **V38** ✅ · Metadata reveal legibility: bare white text over arbitrary cover colors
  (white-on-pink ≈2:1, WCAG fail both modes). Fix direction: back the reveal with a
  sky-tinted glass plate (matte token fallback under Reduce Transparency) or switch to the
  per-mode text token — never raw white over uncontrolled art. — _Done 2026-06-11, merged
  `bd703af`; sky-glass plate (0.30, non-interactive rounded-rect) behind the token text,
  `Palette.surface` matte under Reduce Transparency; paddings tightened so the V37 band
  still holds metadata + cluster at medium. Suites green + dark/light captures in

- **V39** ✅ · Ghost control-cluster residue at rest: a ~20 px icon-pill ghost floats
  mid-cover on the focused book at promotion≈0 (medium type, both modes). Fix direction:
  fully gate the cluster — opacity 0 AND removed from the hierarchy below an emergence
  threshold, so partial-promotion states never leak a miniature pill. — _Done 2026-06-11,
  merged `e0d2b46`; `ControlCluster.visibilityFloor` (0.25) + `isVisible` + remapped
  `opacity` (0 at the floor → 1 at full emerge); the view renders nothing below the floor
  (+4 tests incl. the exact audit-state regression). Suites green; medium-rest dark/light
  ghost-free + XXXL cluster intact in `.agent-loop/artifacts/V39/`._

- **V40** ✅ · Cluster glass is untinted grey (XXXL rest, both modes): grey pill + monochrome
  dark-grey icons on the pink cover — violates "tint glass with sky/aqua; avoid untinted
  grey glass". Fix direction: sky-tinted glass for the pill, token-derived icon color;
  confirm the tint survives on light covers (pink/butter) too. — _Done 2026-06-11, merged
  `ba000b7`; three causes: weak tints (sky 0.45/aqua 0.52 now), luminance-adaptive glass
  flipping `textPrimary` icons (glass path → `ink0`), and the unclamped XXXL diameter
  outgrowing the fixed fan spacing so the controls never split (diameter clamp 68 + derived
  spacing). Also fixed a V37 regression (`.clipped()` amputated the offset-rendered fan —
  layout now declares fan width). Forced-emerge XXXL captures over the pink cover, both
  modes, in `.agent-loop/artifacts/V40/`; suites green._

- **V41** ✅ · Title-fade not engaged at rest (double title): the focused cover's debossed
  title/subtitle stay full strength while the metadata reveal repeats the same strings
  ~150 px away — and at XXXL the cluster sits over the un-faded debossed title. Fix
  direction: drive the V24 deboss-fade from "any focus affordance visible" (metadata OR
  cluster), not solely from promotion progress. — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `9c4bf6f`;
  `BookFocus.debossTitleOpacity` (smoothstep 1→0 over promotion 0…0.4, +5 tests incl. the
  cluster-overlap invariant): the printed title is fully gone before the cluster's
  visibility promotion (≈0.53) and while the metadata reveal is still faint. Both suites
  green; medium+XXXL × dark+light rest captures in `.agent-loop/artifacts/V41/` show one
  title at medium and a blank cover under the XXXL cluster. **P-FIX round 1 complete.**_

## Phase P-FIX — UI audit fixes (round 2)

> Inserted 2026-06-11 by the **independent UI audit** (fresh `main` build 18:49, iPhone 17
> Pro sim, rest-state captures dark/light/XXXL/increased-contrast). Findings + artifacts:
> [ui-audit-log](ui-audit-log.md) §Round 2. Round-1 fixes (V37–V41) verified holding at
> medium rest; these are new/composed defects, all visible at launch rest.

- **V42** ✅ · Focused book unlabeled at XXXL rest (V37×V41 composition): the metadata-yield
  drops the title band while the deboss-fade blanks the cover's printed title — the focused
  card is an empty slab with an anonymous icon pill, and the unfocused neighbor's
  full-strength deboss below reads as the focus label. Fix direction: when `ViewThatFits`
  yields the metadata (cluster-only branch), keep the focused cover's deboss title visible —
  couple `BookFocus.debossTitleOpacity` to *metadata visibility*, not promotion alone; verify
  XXXL × dark+light shows exactly one title on the focused cover. — _Done 2026-06-11, merged
  `3bd998b`; `debossTitleOpacity(promotion:metadataVisible:)` returns 1 when the metadata
  reveal isn't rendered (the deboss IS the label); the rendered `ViewThatFits` branch reports
  via `FocusMetadataVisibleKey` (only the installed branch emits). +3 tests; XXXL+medium ×
  dark+light captures in `.agent-loop/artifacts/V42/` — one title per state, V41 intact._

- **V43** ✅ · Metadata-reveal contrast fails on mid-luminance covers (measured, medium rest,
  both modes): the V38 sky-glass plate blooms the blue cover through — light title ≈1.65:1,
  subtitle ≈1.44:1; dark title ≈2.6:1, subtitle ≈2.0:1 — all below WCAG AA. Fix direction:
  raise the plate's opacity floor (or derive text color from sampled plate luminance) so the
  band *guarantees* ≥4.5:1 small / ≥3:1 large over ANY cover art; verify by sampling pixels
  on the blue and pink covers, both modes. — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `7ec0089`; two causes:
  the weak tint AND the whole band rendering at `opacity == promotion` (~0.5 at rest — text
  itself half-transparent). `BandContrast` pure WCAG math (worst-case-cover blend, 7 tests)
  pins matte-underlay 0.85 + subtitle 0.8 to a guaranteed ≥4.5:1 over ANY cover;
  `metadataRevealOpacity` saturates at promotion 0.5 (band fully opaque at rest, 5 tests).
  **Measured on-sim:** dark 7.63/5.57, light 10.64/6.39 — `.agent-loop/artifacts/V43/`._

  `.agent-loop/artifacts/ui-audit-20260611-1849/crop-light-band.png`
- **V44** ✅ · Debossed subtitle clips the cover's bottom edge at XXXL: the last line
  ("OF DESIGN") rides into the fore-edge page-texture lines (dark) / sits flush against the
  edge (light) — the deboss text block isn't vertically fitted to the cover face at large
  type. Fix direction: inset the deboss block above the fore-edge strip with
  `minimumScaleFactor`/line-limit so the subtitle never reaches the page-edge texture;
  verify XXXL × dark+light. — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `582a35d`; the scale factor sat on
  the title Text alone — block-level `lineLimit+minimumScaleFactor` + 12pt vertical inset.
  Pixel-asserting regression snapshot (red→green, **iOS-only: macOS has no Dynamic Type so

  model (chapter + paragraphIndex pin), audio saved to the container. Mic permission primer.

  (AVAudioRecorderEngine m4a + metering / FakeRecorderEngine), `Memo` @Model (chapter
  cascade, paragraph+ms pin, pending status — transcription = V29), `MemoCapture`
  (pause-while-recording → save ≥400ms into the book's subtree → resume-if-was-playing;
  denied/failure/race recovery; 10 tests). Mic control + aqua level-waveform puck ride the
  reading surface's transport (screen-flows pins memo record to READING — the pin needs a
  live playhead; the library cluster's Memo stays a stub until V30). Entitlement + usage
  string landed. Both suites green; puck snapshots + rest regression in

  `/speak` (real Chatterbox) rendered the fixture sentence → production client `/transcribe`
  (faster-whisper) returned it verbatim — `.agent-loop/artifacts/V29/harness-run.log`._
- **V30** ✅ · Notes state: morphed list state on the surface (never a sheet) — play memo,
  open-at-pin (jump narration to the paragraph), retry, delete; accessibility per the
  [matrix](../03-design/accessibility.md). (needs V29) — _Done 2026-06-11, merged

  pause; open-at-pin seeks the exact pinned ms; delete = `LibraryStore.deleteMemo` w/

  pending/error states, retry-on-error-only, aqua playing accent, VO-labeled actions)
  behind a glass toggle on the reading closeBar. Chapter-scoped by design (cross-book
  Notes = logged parity gap). Both suites green; row snapshots + rest regression in

  ([checklist](final-review-checklist.md) §V31). Live harness over the ENTIRE production
  tree: `addBook`→`/toc`, `/import` (real Chatterbox 77s) → real player; `/speak`-rendered

## Phase P-FIX — UI audit fixes (round 3)

> Inserted 2026-06-11 by the **independent UI audit** (fresh `main` build 20:28, iPhone 17
> Pro sim, rest-state captures dark/light/XXXL/increased-contrast). Findings + artifacts:
> [ui-audit-log](ui-audit-log.md) §Round 3. Round-1/2 fixes (V37–V44) verified holding;
> these are XXXL launch-rest composition defects on/around the focused card.

- **V45** ✅ · Control cluster renders on the focused cover's debossed text at XXXL rest (both
  modes): the glass pill row sits across the subtitle — "DESIGN &" reads through the glass
  between the icons, "HEY" partially behind the pill, "ILLUSTRATION" under its lower edge.
  V42 restored the deboss as the focus label; the cluster still emerges over that exact
  spot. Fix direction: keep V42's invariant (the deboss IS the label) but never render
  icons over glyphs — locally fade/dodge only the deboss lines the pill actually covers, or
  offset the cluster's emergence anchor below the deboss block; verify XXXL × dark+light
  shows label + cluster with zero overlap. — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `21d94b7`;
  `DebossDodge` pure math (8 tests): the cluster's MEASURED frame (`ClusterFrameKey`,
  global-origin calibrated) maps through `CardVisualTop.scale` into a cover-local band; the
  deboss mask fades only the covered lines (10pt feather — a 24pt first cut ate the whole
  label, caught on capture; strength smoothsteps with cluster opacity). Pixel-asserting
  XXXL snapshot + both suites green; XXXL dark+light + medium-regression captures in
  `.agent-loop/artifacts/V45/`. Residual by geometry: the pill covers the title's lower
  third, so "HEY" prints from its upper half only._

- **V46** · Cluster glass frozen mid-meld at XXXL rest (both modes): the four control
  circles render half-merged into a lumpy scalloped blob — neither the discrete circles of
  full emergence (V40 artifacts) nor a clean capsule; at rest the cluster sits between its
  visibility floor and full emergence and freezes in the in-between
  `GlassEffectContainer` merge shape. Fix direction: resolve the rest state to a terminal
  form — snap emergence to a stable endpoint when scroll is at rest (merged capsule or
  fully split circles); mid-meld geometry only while the morph is actually in motion.

- **V47** · Unfocused cover's deboss title collides with the neighbor's overhanging
  fore-edge strip at XXXL (dark clear, light faint): the focused pink card's page-stack
  lines hang below its cover edge and run straight through the top serifs of the blue
  card's "DESIGN BY". V44 inset the deboss from the bottom edge only. Fix direction:
  top-inset the deboss block below the zone the card above overlaps (mirror V44's bottom
  inset), or clip/z-order the fore-edge strip so it never crosses a neighbor's text area;
  verify XXXL × dark+light.

  — _Done 2026-06-11, merged `fbe0373`; `VoiceInput` (pause on open mic, resume at mic
  close — the transcription wait is no conflict; <400ms discard; denied/failed type-instead
  fallbacks; permission-race guard) + panel `HoldToTalkButton` with live Listening…/
  Transcribing… rows; transcript appends to the draft, never auto-sent. 9 tests, both
  suites green; dark/light captures in `.agent-loop/artifacts/V34/`._
- **V35** ✅ · Spoken replies + persistence: speaker control → `POST /speak` → played on the
  shared audio engine with the same pause/resume rule; **Save** persists the thread;
  Conversations as a morphed list state (reopen read-only, delete). (needs V33)

  chapter MP3 survives; pause at speech start, resume-if-was-playing; toggle-stop;
  failure flags, text stays) + speaker chips on assistant bubbles; Save header chip →
  `saveChatThread` titled by the opening question; Conversations = a morphed face of the
  same panel plane (list → read-only thread → back; delete). 11 new tests, both suites
  green; captures in `.agent-loop/artifacts/V35/`. Note: plays on its OWN ephemeral
  engine rather than literally "the shared audio engine" — the established MemoNotes
